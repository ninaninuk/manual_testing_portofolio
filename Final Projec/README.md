# Final project for ITF Manual Testing Course

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application. 

Application under test: https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/

API Documentation: https://orangehrm.github.io/orangehrm-api-doc/

**The final project is split into 2 sections: [Testing section](https://github.com/ninaninuk/manual_testing_portofolio/blob/main/Final%20Projec/README.md#1-testing-section) and [SQL section](https://github.com/ninaninuk/manual_testing_portofolio/blob/main/Final%20Projec/README.md#2-sql-section).**

Tools used: JIRA, Zephyr Squad, Postman, MySQL Workbench

# 1 Testing section

## 1.1 Test Planning

The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the X module from the OrangeHRM application. 

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan

## 1.2 Test Monitoring and Control

It will be done by generating periodic reports that reflect the current status of the test.

## 1.3 Test Analysis

The testing process will be executed based on the above requirements for the Dependents module. The following test conditions were found:
 * Enter test conditions here

## 1.4 Test Design

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases 
are:

# 2 SQL section

Created a database named 'orange hrm' and a table named 'languages' with all the columns needed to save data per specifications. Performed different queries inside the sql file:[languages.sql](https://github.com/ninaninuk/manual_testing_portofolio/blob/temp-2/Final%20Projec/languages.sql)
